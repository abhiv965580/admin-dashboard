# Description:

This Repo introduces the Admin Dashboard Project of the Odin Project's Intermediate HTML and CSS section. From this project I've implemented the use of grids to customize the layout of the web-page.

The screenshot of UI is attached in this Repo for reference

## Implementations:

- Used tailwind CSS to get color actually needed in this project
- Sidebar icon's are SVGs taken from https://pictogrammers.com/library/mdi/
- Profile picture's of users are downloaded from https://www.flaticon.com/free-icons/profile
- Mostly used **Display: grid** property as stated by the project description
- Currently there is dummy content in the **project description** and **announcements** as well
